Welcome to iSim, your friendly neighborhood intersectionality simulator.

~~~~BACKGROUND~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This app is a passion-project of mine, the idea for which was birthed during undergrad amidst my intersectional feminist studies. I envisioned a dynamic 3D bubble-cluster-esque model that would more accurately represent the interactions between and nuances amongst a person's myriad (and at times, shifting) intersectional identity categories. I couldn't be more excited to be putting pen to paper (finger to key..?) and making this baby of mine into a real web app.

First things first, if you're unfamiliar with the term "intersectionality" (or would just like a refresher), do not fret! Please check out the below resources. I recognize that intersectionality as a concept can be intimidating and seem complicated at first glance, and I'm committed to making this accessible to all, whether you're super familiar with, or this is your first time hearing about, it.

tl;dr (my smol definition of intersectionality for the purposes of this project):
  A person's intersectional identity as a whole is a collection of social categories within which they identify and thus shape the way they experience the world on a day-to-day basis (race, class, and gender are some examples of such categories). A key tenet of intersectionality as a theory is that these categories cannot exist in isolation, as the ways in whey they interplay with and affect each other are inextricably interwoven into a person's lived experience. Furthermore, these overlapping identity categories can be used to better understand and illustrate the nature of privilege and oppression. The term was first used in 1989 by Kimberl√© Crenshaw, a badass scholar and law professor.

  ~~~~~~HOW-TO~~~~~~
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use this app, you must first create an account. The auth flow is pretty simple, just hit the "Create Account" button from the landing page. Enter your email address (must be unique - i.e. it can't have already been used to create an account), name, and password. Then head back to the landing page and you'll be able to log in using your newly-created credentials.

Post-auth, you're now whisked away to the logged-in homepage, where you can view all your saved models and create a new one if you so desire. Creating a new model is a good place to start if it's your first time here. When you hit the "Create a Model" button, you'll be taken to a form within which you can insert a title for your new model, and as many or as few categories as you'd like (due to time constraints in building out the first v1 of this guy, you're currently limited to creating between 1-8 categories, which will change in the future as I build it out with algorithms that dynamically generate the 3D models).

Now that you've created your model, you can now return to your homepage and find it within the "Saved Models" category. Clicking on it (or any of your saved models) will give you a more detailed view, including the 3D model image. Feel free to edit or delete it from there. And of course, when you're ready to log out, hit the corresponding button in the upper right corner.
